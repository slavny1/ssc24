**I developed an application in SwiftUI, which provides users with accurate directional information. To determine true North, I used CoreLocation, Apple's built-in functionality that offers robust geolocation capabilities. Initially, I considered a custom solution with CoreMotion and sensors, but the effectiveness of CoreLocation's trueNorth functionality led me to choose this method.**

**Using the true North reference, I calculate bearings for all user points, a key feature of the app. This process is based on geometric principles. While the Pythagorean theorem is sufficient for flat surfaces, the Earth's curvature requires a more advanced solution. To accurately determine the initial bearing or forward azimuth between two points, I use the Haversine formula. This fundamental tool in navigation and trigonometry calculates the great-circle distance between coordinates on Earth's spherical surface. With a few additional steps, the same formula helps me calculate bearings.**

**Additionally, I use Combine to observe and apply changes in the user's position and to monitor the JSON data with coordinates of a large number of cities. This data is uploaded to enhance the user experience by making it easier and smoother.**
